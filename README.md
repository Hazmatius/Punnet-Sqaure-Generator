Punnet-Sqaure-Generator
=======================

Given gene input in the form XxYy, creates a punnet sqaure.

Open the jar file in the terminal. When it opens, you will be prompted to enter in the two chromosomes to be crossed. These sets of alleles should be entered in the form AaBBcc... remember that the longer the chromosome you type in, the longer it will take to generate the punnet sqaure. On my computer, things start to slow down around the AaBbCcDdEeFfGg level. Afterwards, it will print out the punnet square, as well as the genotypic and phenotypic ratios.
